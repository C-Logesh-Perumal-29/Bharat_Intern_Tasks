# 1) Stock Price Prediction :

  ##  Introduction
  
  - The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for stock price movements using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN).
  - Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets.
  - LSTM networks, known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies, are well-suited for time series data, making them a suitable choice for predicting stock prices.

  ## Methodology
